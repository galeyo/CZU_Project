							<p class="content-info">This is a curved gaming monitor with a diagonal of 27 inches and a resolution of Full HD, with a screen resolution of 16: 9, a radius of curvature of 1800 mm and the absence of "frames on the sides of the screen." The refresh rate and adaptive synchronization (Adaptive-Sync) ensure gamers a comfortable game, eliminating the so-called "gaps" of the image.

								Frame rate is twice as fast as other monitors. Thanks to frequent updates, you will have the opportunity to see all the shots, and you will be able to accurately strike at the enemy and appreciate the high-speed races in all their manifestations</p>

							<p class="content-info">The advantages of the sony camera are really many, let's dwell only on some of them, since each user will be able to love this device for its own particularity.
								Superb picture and video quality. And this is not a trivial phrase, designed to attract buyers. The camera perfectly behaves as in shooting in normal conditions, and when working at night, with winds, minus temperatures and heat.
								High speed shooting, allowing you to do 10 frames per second. It turns out that sony a7r 3 is worth buying for fans of reporting or wedding photography, for which this mode is ideal.
								An advanced battery that holds a charge for much longer, which is important for on-site shooting. And thanks to the availability of appropriate connectors, the device can now be charged from the powerbank.</p>

							<h3 class="content-title">DJI Mavic 2 Pro</h3>
							<p class="content-info">Mavic is equipped not only with a nasal stereo camera, but also with a similar pair in the back of the case. In addition, the copter is equipped with an infrared sensor on the back. Coupled with an advanced GPS system, the drone identifies obstacles with unprecedented speed and accuracy, which is also the updated APAS system. The copter is equipped with an advanced 3-axis hanger with a tilt speed of 120˚ / s and 8 GB of flash memory. Having retained all the advantages of the design of the first "Mavik", the copter acquired an even more aerodynamic shape and gained a sail value 19% more than the predecessor model. In the unfolded state, the apparatus has dimensions of 322 × 242 × 84 mm, and in the folded state - 214 × 91 × 84 mm. The rounded shape silhouettes and sleek elements have achieved an incredible top speed of 72 km / h. In this case, the flight range (with an impressive speed of 50 km / h) is as much as 18 km. The maximum flight time is now 31 minutes!</p>

							<h3 class="content-title">Alienware Area-51</h3>
							<p class="content-info">The Area-51 makes quite the first impression. It’s 569mm tall and 272mm wide, and most of the front panel is covered with slats of dark, glossy plastic. RGB LEDs ring the slatted section and sit on the side panels, and the front has the familiar Alienware logo as its power button.

								Each point of the triangular case is bolstered by a metal handle that makes it easier to tilt the machine to get at its various ports and sockets. Build quality is superb, which is to be expected from a PC of this size and price. The metal used throughout the case is solid, and the plastic, too, is sturdy.
								
								This is all good news, but the Area-51 Threadripper remains a difficult machine to live with. The sheer size of this rig precludes it from easy travelling to LAN parties and gaming events, and the awkward shape makes it trickier to store neatly beneath a desk than a conventional tower.</p>
